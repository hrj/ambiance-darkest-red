## Ambiance Darkest Red

This is a theme for GTK based on the [Ambiance Dark Red theme](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Ambiance+Dark+Red+Theme?content=165030) by Atomakt.

I have deepened the shades of grey to suit my eyes.

## Installation in Ubuntu

```
cd ~/.themes
git clone https://github.com/hrj/ambiance-darkest-red.git
```

Then use the `Ubuntu Tweak Tool` to select this theme.
